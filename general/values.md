### Five dysfunctions <a id="five-dysfunctions"></a>

Our values help us to prevent the [five dysfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary).

1. **Absence of trust** Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group =&gt; _prevented by collaboration, specifically kindness_
2. **Fear of conflict** Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate =&gt; _prevented by transparency, specifically directness_
3. **Lack of commitment** Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization =&gt; _prevented by transparency, specifically directness_
4. **Avoidance of accountability** Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards =&gt; _prevented by results, iteration, and transparency_
5. **Inattention to results** Focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success =&gt; _prevented by results_

Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values, for example trust is not one of our values. Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly. We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given

### Why have values <a id="why-have-values"></a>

Our values should give guidelines on how to behave and must be actionable. They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from people we hire. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making, they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.

### How do we reinforce our values <a id="how-do-we-reinforce-our-values"></a>

Whatever behavior you reward will become your values. We reinforce our values through the following actions:

1. By what we do, especially what the leadership does.
2. By what we select for during hiring.
3. By what we emphasize during on-boarding.
4. By what criteria we use for promotions
5. By what criteria we use for bonuses.
6. By what behavior we compliment.
7. By what criteria we use to let people go.

### Permission to play <a id="permission-to-play"></a>

From our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious, we call them our permission to play behavior:

* Be truthful and honest.
* Be dependable, reliable, fair, and respectful.
* Be committed, creative, inspiring, and passionate.
* Be deserving of the trust of our users and customers.
* Act in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.
