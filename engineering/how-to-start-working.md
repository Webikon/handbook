# How to start working

### Access to Everything <a id="access-to-everything"></a>

Depending on what exactly you’re doing, you’ll need access to a wide variety of things. The key tools you’ll need for day-to-day development:

* [Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/home/1313088028278)
* [Slack](https://webikon.slack.com) – Make sure to join \#developers channel.
* [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/webikon)/[Buddy](https://app.buddy.works/webikon)
* 1Password

You should be given access to these by Jan or Mauro, but if not, ask! Make sure to enable two-factor authentication where possible.

There are other tools you may need access to. We’re pretty liberal with access, but it can be pain to go through and set these all up, so you probably don’t want access to everything unless you need it. You can always get it later if you do need __it, so don’t be afraid to ask.

* \*\*\*\*[**SupportPal**](https://support.webikon.sk/en/admin)\*\*\*\*
* **Wodby** – For the servers team, or anyone who needs to manage server access. Ask in \#support for access.

### Your Tools <a id="your-tools"></a>

We’re pretty flexible about the tools we use, and if you’ve already happy with your setup, you probably won’t need to change!

Here’s what we are usually using:

* **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
* **Editor/IDE**: phpStorm, Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code
* **VM/Local Server**: Laragon \(Windows only\), [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com/), [DDev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/), [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/)
* **Git client**: git command line, Tower, SourceTree, GitKraken

If you don’t already have choices here, or you’re looking for a change, don't hesitate to try it out or ask team if they have any experience with this new tool.

Also make sure, you have installed all needed package managers and libraries we use, some may need other dependencies, like PHP, Ruby, etc.:

* **npm/yarn**
* **composer**
* **SASS**

You can find more on basic local development setup in [Roots docs](https://roots.io/getting-started/docs/development-environment-recommendations/).

### How We Work <a id="how-we-work"></a>

Next sections of the handbook are all about how Webikon works, and you should read all of them for a good overview. Don't hesitate to ask lots of questions :\)
