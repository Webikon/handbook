# Development Process

#### \*\*\*\*[**https://engineering.hmn.md/how-we-work/process/development/**](https://engineering.hmn.md/how-we-work/process/development/)\*\*\*\*

### Steps <a id="steps"></a>

The general process for development is:

#### **1. Determining MVP and assigning task in Asana**

Before you start, make sure task is broken down to the minimum viable product. If it can be broken up into multiple smaller tasks, it should be. This allows better isolation of work, and better tracking for the project managers.

Tasks should succinctly describe how to fix them. Vague descriptions make it hard to know when the task is complete, and can make it harder for other people to get involved in the project.

Also make sure you understand everything what needs to be done, otherwise ask for more info!

#### 2. Write the code

Now the harder part :\)

- working on develop or feature branches - how they work  
- git flow

Ask for help when you're stuck. Don't try to solve everything by yourself, give it let's say 30-60 minutes and if you're still stuck, ask your team mates for help.

**3. Push early, push often, report your progress**

As soon as your code is in a usable state, you should push it up. This allows tracking the issue over time a little easier, and avoids cases where you disappear for a while to sort out an issue. It also allows others to watch and potentially correct a wrong assumption before you spend hours on it, and will trigger automated testing if set up for the repo.

You donâ€™t need to push every commit, but be sensible.

If you have some work done and it's not completely ready yet or you forgot it to push it or whatever reason, please, let others in your team know your progress on this task.

Also let PM and your team mates know your progress on the task by the end of the day, preferably by commenting in Asana or messaging him on Slack.

**5. Code review, test**

When you think your work is done, ask your team mate for code review.

**6. Iterate and complete** 

Work on reported issues from code review, iterate and finish you code.

**8. Merge and deploy**

When your work is done, your code would be merged to `master` and deployed.
