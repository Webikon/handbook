# Deployments

We handle CI/CD with **Buddy** or **Gitlab,** but slowly moving all projects to Gitlab.

Before files are actually deployed, we are also building theme assets.

Pushing to `develop` branch usually runs automatic deploy to project's DEV server.

All deployments to LIVE server has to be run manually!
