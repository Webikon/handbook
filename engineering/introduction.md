# Introduction

This is a practical guide to working on projects and building things at Webikon.

For more on about internal culture, our visions, hiring process and other interesting stuff see [General](../general/) section.

We hope you like this guide. It has been built by all of us at Webikon, just for you.

### An Important Note <a id="an-important-note"></a>

One of the key aspects of Webikon is individuality. While we’re publishing this handbook with both **descriptive** \(“this is how we work”\) and **prescriptive** \(“this is how we want to work”\) information, it’s important to note that **these are guidelines, not rules**. We often debate various things internally, and projects can have inconsistencies from each other. Sometimes, this is a good thing. The flip side of consistency can be monoculture, where experimentation is discouraged.

Engineers can often get caught up in issues like “what’s the best way to do this?”. While we obviously want to work from the best possible starting position, there’s nothing to say you have to stay there. Take the best that’s available and run with it.

**Experiment. Deconstruct. Rebuild. Blow it all away and start from scratch.**

Some of the best projects come from a dissatisfaction with the status quo. If there are things in this guide you disagree with, _fix them_. Nothing will ever be perfect. Maybe something that’s annoying you today turns into a better tool for everyone tomorrow.

This guide is a living set of documents, and will be updated as we continue to refine, refactor, and rebuild our processes and tooling.
