# Structure

Even in small team, each person needs to have responsibilities and people needs to choose role which suits them the best.

So you can be project manager, engineer, salesman, first line support or HR. 

Let's say you want to be an engineer. You may want to focus on UX or design or frontend or backend or even be our Gutenberg specialist.

There are no limits :\) 

Yes of course, not everybody in the team can be engineer and focus only on design, so we are consulting every role or need for particular role in the team. But you get the point...
