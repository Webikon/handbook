# Communication

As a remote company, communication is at the heart of how we work. Because we’re \(generally\) not in the same office, we need to be efficient and effective at communicating using the tools we have at our disposal.

It’s important to be aware of how communication affects you as an engineer. As Webikon is a remote company only, you need to have good communication skills and the ability to be self-directed. This requires you to effectively communicate progress, be open about difficulties you encounter and speak up where you see problems in architectural decisions or unrealistic task estimates.

If you spot problems or concerns with the way that a project is designed, implemented, or managed, it is your responsibility to share your concerns with the team. This also applies to other areas like the sales pipeline or wider Webikon conversations. Without communication about issues that arise, underlying issues cannot be corrected or improved for the next time.

Generally, we try to incorporate all feedback into decisions we make, even when those decisions are not necessarily the consensus. Ultimately, the project manager and tech lead on a project are responsible for making the final call, and communicating problems helps inform their decisions.

This same concept applies across the company; we rarely make decisions without incorporating feedback from everyone, and we iterate on decisions based on feedback to constantly improve. Communication through our weekly updates and project retrospectives allows us to passively gather this feedback, but you should also actively give feedback when you see problems.

An ideal place to give feedback is during regular meetings or Webikon days. This allows you to share the feedback directly with the people making decisions, and discuss potential solutions. You should always feel comfortable sharing feedback, but if you’d rather share it privately, you can discuss with your project manager or developer buddy.
